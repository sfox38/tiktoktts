"""TikTok TTS platform - Home Assistant TextToSpeechEntity implementation.

This file defines TikTokTTSEntity, the single TTS entity created by this
integration. It handles:

  - Voice selection and language-to-voice mapping
  - Random voice resolution from a user-configured language pool
  - Routing requests to either the proxy API or the direct TikTok API
  - Text chunking for long messages (direct mode only)
  - Retry logic with configurable attempts and backoff delay
  - Automatic endpoint fallback across multiple regional URLs (direct mode)
  - Structured error logging so problems are easy to diagnose in the HA logs
  - HA repair issue raised on expired session_id (direct mode) so the user
    sees a clear action item in the UI rather than just a log entry

API modes
---------
PROXY mode  - POST to {endpoint}/api/generation with JSON body {"text":..., "voice":...}
              Response is JSON {"data": "<base64-encoded mp3>"}.
              The Weilbyte proxy handles chunking internally, so the full message
              text can be sent in one request regardless of length.

DIRECT mode - POST to {endpoint}/media/api/text/speech/invoke/ with query params.
              Response is JSON {"status_code": 0, "data": {"v_str": "<base64 mp3>"}}.
              TikTok enforces a ~200-character limit per request, so long messages
              are split into sentence/word-boundary chunks by _split_text(), each
              fetched individually and then concatenated into one audio file.
              If the configured endpoint fails, the code automatically retries
              against all other known regional TikTok API URLs.

Random voice mode
-----------------
When voice=random is passed in options, async_get_tts_audio picks a voice at
random from the language pool stored in hass.data[DOMAIN][HASS_DATA_RANDOM_LANGS].
Cache uniqueness is handled by the caller: button.py passes a unique _random_seed
in the options dict for each call, which HA includes in the cache key hash so
every random voice call is a guaranteed cache miss.

Config is read dynamically on every call
-----------------------------------------
All four config properties (_api_mode, _endpoint, _voice, _session_id) are
@property methods that read live from self._config_entry.data on every access.
This means that after the options flow saves new settings and the integration
reloads, the entity immediately uses the updated values - no further restart needed.

        timeout, or a non-zero TikTok status_code), automatically moves to the
        next endpoint in DIRECT_API_ENDPOINTS and retries. This makes the
        integration resilient to individual regional endpoints going down.

        The one exception is status_code 4 (invalid/expired session_id) - in
        that case we give up immediately across all endpoints, since the session_id
        is a global credential and retrying with it against other regional endpoints
        is pointless. A HA repair issue is also raised so the user sees a clear

    Used by the direct API path because TikTok's internal API enforces a

    Split priority:
      1. Sentence boundary - looks for the last '. ', '! ', or '? ' within
         the allowed window and splits after the punctuation mark. Using
         delimiter+space avoids false splits on abbreviations (Dr., U.S.),
         numbers (3.14), and URLs. Produces the most natural-sounding audio
         since each chunk ends at a complete sentence.
      2. Word boundary - if no sentence boundary exists, splits at the last
         space within the window. Avoids cutting words in half.
      3. Hard split - last resort if the text contains no spaces or punctuation
         within the window (e.g. a very long URL or foreign-language text without
         spaces). Splits at exactly chunk_size characters.

    Returns a list of one or more non-empty strings. If the input fits within
    chunk_size, the list contains only the original text unchanged.
