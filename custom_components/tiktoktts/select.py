"""Select entities for TikTok TTS - language, voice, and device dropdowns.

Singleton pattern
-----------------
The language, voice, and device select entities are shared across all config
entries (proxy and direct). They are created exactly once - when the first
config entry loads - and skipped for any subsequent entries. This means:

  select.tiktoktts_language  (one, shared)
  select.tiktoktts_voice     (one, shared)
  select.tiktoktts_device    (one, shared)

A flag in hass.data[DOMAIN] tracks whether the shared entities exist so that
reloads and multiple config entries don't create duplicates.

Language / Voice filtering
--------------------------
Selecting a language automatically rebuilds the voice dropdown to show only
voices for that language group. The voice state is a friendly label; the raw
API code is exposed via the 'code' state attribute for automation use.

Random Voice support
--------------------
When the user configures a random voice pool (via the dashboard card's dice
button), a "Random Voice" language option appears at the top of the language
dropdown. Selecting it sets the voice dropdown to a single "Random Voice"
option. The actual voice is resolved at speak time by tts.py.

The language entity stores the random voice pool in hass.data[DOMAIN] and
exposes it via the 'random_voice_languages' state attribute so the dashboard
card can read the current pool to pre-check the language checkboxes.

The language entity is stored in hass.data[DOMAIN][HASS_DATA_LANGUAGE_ENTITY]
so the set_random_voices service handler in __init__.py can call
async_refresh_random_voice_option() directly without going through the
unreliable entity_components lookup.

Restore-on-restart
------------------
All three entities use RestoreEntity to persist selections across HA restarts.
The language entity restores first (it is passed to async_add_entities before
the voice entity). The voice entity reads the language entity's restored code
directly via a stored reference to rebuild the correct options list before
restoring the saved voice. This ordering dependency is deliberate and documented.
The language entity defers voice entity notification for the RANDOM_VOICE_CODE
case only, via async_create_task with a retry loop, to handle the case where
the voice entity's async_added_to_hass has not yet run.

Device select
-------------
Populated dynamically from hass.states at startup. Shows HA friendly names
in the dropdown. The raw entity_id is exposed via the 'code' state attribute.
