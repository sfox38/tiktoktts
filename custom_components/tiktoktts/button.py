"""Button entity for TikTok TTS - the Speak button.

Singleton pattern
-----------------
One shared button entity is created for the whole integration:

  button.tiktoktts_speak

When pressed it reads the current state of the other shared entities:
  - text.tiktoktts_message    - the message to speak
  - select.tiktoktts_voice    - the voice API code (via 'code' attribute)
  - select.tiktoktts_device   - the media_player entity_id (via 'code' attribute)

It then calls tts.speak directly in Python - no templates, no scripts,
no YAML gymnastics required. The dashboard card becomes simply:

  type: entities
  title: TikTok TTS
  entities:
    - select.tiktoktts_language
    - select.tiktoktts_voice
    - text.tiktoktts_message
    - select.tiktoktts_device
    - button.tiktoktts_speak

TTS entity selection
--------------------
The button picks the correct TTS entity (proxy or direct) by inspecting
loaded config entries via ConfigEntryState.LOADED rather than checking
hass.states. This avoids a bug where stale state machine entries from a
previously removed config entry would cause the button to target a TTS
entity that no longer exists. Proxy mode is preferred over direct mode
when both are configured.

Random voice support
--------------------
When the selected voice code is RANDOM_VOICE_CODE ("random"), the button:
  1. Sets cache=False so HA does not serve stale audio from the file cache.
  2. Sets hass.data[DOMAIN]["_random_voice_active"] = True before calling
     tts.speak. This flag is read by _RandomVoiceAwareCache (in __init__.py)
     which intercepts HA's in-memory TTS cache lookup and returns a miss,
     forcing async_get_tts_audio in tts.py to be called on every press
     regardless of message text. Without this, HA would return the first
     cached audio forever.
  The flag is cleared inside async_get_tts_audio after the random voice is
  resolved, then immediately set back to True, creating a self-perpetuating
  mechanism so subsequent automation tts.speak calls also get fresh voices.
