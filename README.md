## Installation

<details><summary>

## Important: Click here if you are upgrading from the original Integration!
</summary>

  
If you were using [philipp-luettecke/tiktoktts](https://github.com/philipp-luettecke/tiktoktts), this fork has **breaking changes** that require a clean removal before installing. You cannot simply overwrite the old files. You can [skip this section](#configuration) if you have not installed the previous integration.

### Breaking Changes

| What changed | Original | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| **Configuration method** | `configuration.yaml` | UI config flow (Settings -> Devices & Services) |
| **Entity ID** | May vary | `tts.tiktoktts_proxy` (proxy mode) or `tts.tiktoktts_direct` (direct mode) |
| **Default language** | `de` (German) | `en_us` (English US) |
| **Default voice** | `de_001` | `en_us_001` |
| **`platform:` entry in YAML** | Required | **Must be removed** |

### Step 1: Remove the `platform:` entry from `configuration.yaml`

Open your `configuration.yaml` and delete the TikTok TTS platform entry. It will look something like this - remove the whole block:

```yaml
tts:
  - platform: tiktoktts
    api_endpoint: https://tiktok-tts.weilnet.workers.dev
    voice: en_us_001
```

If `tts:` was only used for TikTok TTS, remove the entire `tts:` section. If you have other TTS platforms listed under `tts:`, remove only the `tiktoktts` entry and leave the others.

### Step 2: Delete the Old Integration Files

In your `config/custom_components/` directory, delete the entire `tiktoktts/` folder and everything inside it.

### Step 3: Clear the Old TTS Cache

HA caches generated audio files and sometimes holds on to old entity state. Go to **Developer Tools -> States** and confirm no `tiktoktts` entities remain. If any do, click each one and use the delete (bin) icon to remove them.

### Step 4: Restart Home Assistant

Go to **Settings -> System -> Restart** and do a full restart (not Quick Reload).

### Step 5: Install This Fork and Reconfigure

Follow the [Installation](#installation) steps below. When you reach **Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration**, you will go through the new UI setup wizard to reconfigure your endpoint and default voice.

> [!NOTE]
> Any automations that used the depricated `tts.tiktoktts_say` service call will need to be updated to use the `tts.speak` action format shown in the [Usage](#usage) section below.
</details>


### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant sidebar.
2. Click the three-dot menu (top right) and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Paste `https://github.com/sfox38/tiktoktts` and select **Integration** as the category.
4. Click **Add**, then find **tiktoktts** in the HACS Integration list and click **Download**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release zip from this repository and unpack it.
2. Copy the `tiktoktts` folder into your `config/custom_components/` directory. The result should be `config/custom_components/tiktoktts/`.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Configuration

After restarting, go to **Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration** and search for **TikTokTTS**.

### Connection Modes

#### Community Proxy (recommended)
Uses the open-source proxy by [Weilbyte](https://github.com/Weilbyte/tiktok-tts). No TikTok account required. The default endpoint is `https://tiktok-tts.weilnet.workers.dev`.

For better reliability, you can self-host your own proxy instance and enter its URL during setup. See the [Weilbyte repo](https://github.com/Weilbyte/tiktok-tts) for instructions.

#### Direct API ⚠️
Calls TikTok's internal API directly using your TikTok session cookie.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This uses TikTok's undocumented API and may violate TikTok's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

Requires a `sessionid` cookie from a logged-in TikTok browser session:
1. **Log in** to TikTok in your browser (you must have a TikTok account)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Application -> Cookies
3. Copy the value of the `sessionid` cookie

The integration will automatically try multiple regional TikTok endpoints if the primary one fails. You must input a valid `sessionid` cookie value or you will not be able to proceed.

---

## Usage

### Entity Names

Each configured instance creates its own entity with a fixed ID based on the connection mode:

| Mode | Friendly Name | Entity ID |
|---|---|---|
| Community Proxy | TikTokTTS Proxy | `tts.tiktoktts_proxy` |
| Direct API | TikTokTTS Direct | `tts.tiktoktts_direct` |

Both entities can coexist if you have configured both modes. Use the appropriate entity ID in your automations depending on which connection you want to use.

The integration also creates these **shared** helper entities (one set regardless of how many instances you have configured). They are only used by the Home Assistant UI and dashboard cards, you generally won't need to manage them yourself:

| Entity ID | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `select.tiktoktts_language` | Language selector dropdown |
| `select.tiktoktts_voice` | Voice selector dropdown (filtered by language) |
| `select.tiktoktts_device` | Output device selector (auto-populated from your media players) |
| `text.tiktoktts_message` | Text input field for the message to speak |
| `button.tiktoktts_speak` | Speak button - reads the above entities and calls tts.speak |

### tts.speak action

**Proxy mode:**
```yaml
action: tts.speak
target:
  entity_id: tts.tiktoktts_proxy
data:
  media_player_entity_id: media_player.your_speaker
  message: "Hello, this is TikTok TTS"
  language: en_us
  options:
    voice: en_us_007
```

**Direct API mode:**
```yaml
action: tts.speak
target:
  entity_id: tts.tiktoktts_direct
data:
  media_player_entity_id: media_player.your_speaker
  message: "Hello, this is TikTok TTS"
  language: en_us
  options:
    voice: en_us_007
```

The `language` field filters available voices in the Automations editor UI, however it is recommended to leave this blank. The `options.voice` field selects the specific voice. If you omit `options.voice`, the integration will use your configured default voice (if it matches the selected language) or the first available voice for the requested language.

### Random Voice

You can configure a pool of language groups to draw from randomly on each `tts.speak` call. Press the 🎲 dice button next to the Speak button in the dashboard card to open the Random Voice settings panel. Tick the language groups you want included in the pool and press "Save and close". Once at least one language is selected, `🎲 Random Voice` appears as an option in the language dropdown with a single `Random Voice` voice option beneath it.

A different voice is picked on every call -- the integration bypasses HA's in-memory TTS cache when random voice is active, so you always get a fresh voice regardless of message text or call source.

To use random voice in an automation, pass `voice: random` in the options:

```yaml
action: tts.speak
target:
  entity_id: tts.tiktoktts_proxy
data:
  media_player_entity_id: media_player.your_speaker
  message: "Hello, this is TikTok TTS"
  options:
    voice: random
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `cache` setting has no effect when `voice: random` is used. The integration always bypasses the cache for random voice calls to ensure a fresh voice is selected every time, regardless of whether you set `cache: true` or `cache: false`.

### Voice Examples

These samples were generated using TikTok TTS with a selection of English voices.
> [!NOTE]
>Github doesn't support in-line audio, you will need to download these mp3 files first.

| Sample | Voice ID |
|---|---|
| [▶ Listen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/main/examples/joke1.mp3) | `en_us_rocket` |
| [▶ Listen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/main/examples/joke2.mp3) | `en_male_narration` |
| [▶ Listen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/main/examples/joke3.mp3) | `en_us_ghostface` |
| [▶ Listen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/main/examples/joke4.mp3) | `en_us_006` |
| [▶ Listen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/main/examples/joke5.mp3) | `en_male_m03_lobby` |
| [▶ Listen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/main/examples/joke6.mp3) | `en_female_emotional` | 


### Dashboard Cards

This integration creates a set of shared helper entities plus a custom dashboard card which all work together as a TTS control panel. You can use this card to easily preview voices, or to send impromptu messages to speakers around your home. The dashboard card will look like the one shown at the top of this page.

You don't need to install this dashboard card separately, it is automatically installed along with this integration. To add this card to any dashboard - search for `TikTokTTS` when adding a new card using the wizard, or just create an empty dashboard card with the following text:

```yaml
type: custom:tiktoktts-card
```

Alternatively, you can create a standard dashboard card using only the TikTok TTS entities:

```yaml
type: entities
title: TikTok TTS
entities:
  - select.tiktoktts_language
  - select.tiktoktts_voice
  - text.tiktoktts_message
  - select.tiktoktts_device
  - button.tiktoktts_speak
```

**How it works:**

1. Select a language from `select.tiktoktts_language` - the voice list filters automatically. Select `🎲 Random Voice` to use the random voice feature.
2. Select a voice from `select.tiktoktts_voice`
3. Type your message in `text.tiktoktts_message` (maximum 255 characters)
4. Select your output speaker from `select.tiktoktts_device` - auto-populated from all available media players in your HA instance, and updates automatically when new devices come online
5. Press the Speak button - reads all fields and calls `tts.speak` server-side
6. Press the 🎲 dice button next to Speak to open the Random Voice settings panel, where you can select which language groups to include in the random voice pool

> [!NOTE]
> All selections are remembered across HA restarts. The device list automatically refreshes when media players become available, including late-loading integrations like browser_mod.

> [!NOTE]
> The voices currently supported by this integration represent the entire confirmed working set as of early 2026. TikTok's internal API supports additional voices beyond this list, but their exact API IDs are not publicly documented. Further, some voices may be locale specific, so you may not be able to use certain voices in your region, although in my own tests they all seem to work when using proxy mode. If you discover a working voice ID that is not already in our list, please [submit a new Issue here](https://github.com/sfox38/tiktoktts/issues) and I can add it to the next release.

### Changing the Default Voice

Go to **Settings -> Devices & Services -> TikTok TTS -> Configure** (gear icon). Changes take effect immediately after saving, no restart required.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy endpoint is unreliable
The community Weilbyte proxy is a free, volunteer-run service and may occasionally be unavailable. For a more reliable setup, self-host your own proxy instance. See [Weilbyte/tiktok-tts](https://github.com/Weilbyte/tiktok-tts).

### Direct API: session_id expired
TikTok session IDs expire periodically. If you see errors about an invalid or expired session ID, go to the integration options and update the value from your browser cookies.

### Message too long error
The message text entity has a maximum length of 255 characters, which is enforced by HA's text entity platform. The dashboard card enforces this limit in the textarea. If you are calling `tts.speak` from an automation with a longer message, TikTok's direct API will handle chunking automatically - only the HA entity has the 255 character restriction.

### Check the logs
Go to **Settings -> System -> Logs** and filter for `tiktoktts` to find detailed error messages.

## Disclaimer

This integration is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to TikTok or ByteDance in any way. The direct API mode uses an unofficial, reverse-engineered endpoint. Use of the direct API mode may violate TikTok's Terms of Service.
